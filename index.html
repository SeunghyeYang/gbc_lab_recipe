                <p class="p">Does everyone need to know how to whip up a pie crust from scratch, or build a towering, elaborately decorated layer cake? Absolutely not. 
                    But every cook should have at least one good dessert up their sleeve, and this classic, lightly glazed lemon pound cake should be yours. <strong>Rich and tender, not too sweet</strong>, 
                    and fragrant from tons of lemon zest, it's the kind of baked good you can just as easily serve with coffee in the afternoon or as the finale to a sit-down dinner party. 
                    <br><br>Nobody will get mad if you top each slice with a scoop of ice cream, a dollop of homemade whipped cream, or even just a spoonful of good Greek yogurt.
                    You will need a couple of pieces of equipment, namely a loaf pan and a hand mixer, but both are kitchen essentials and not very expensive—consider this your excuse to invest.</p>

                <h2 class="h2">How to make...</h2> 
                    <h3 class="h3">Step 1.</h3>
                    <img src="img/Lemon-Pound-Cake-1.jpg" class="imgs">
                    <p class="p">Heat oven to <strong>180C/160C</strong> fan/gas 4. Butter and flour a loaf tin measuring 22 x 11 x 7cm. Sift the flour with a pinch of salt, bicarbonate of soda and baking powder. 
                    Beat the butter and sugar until pale and fluffy, then add the lemon zest. Gradually add the eggs a little at a time, beating well after each addition. 
                    Mix the buttermilk with the lemon juice. Fold the flour mixture into the batter, alternating with the buttermilk and lemon mixture.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="h3">Step 2.</h3>
                    <img src="img/Lemon-Pound-Cake-14.jpg" class="imgs">
                    <p class="p">Scrape the batter into the loaf tin and bake for <strong>40-45 mins</strong>, or until a skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean. 
                    Leave to sit for 10 mins, then turn out onto a wire cooling rack with a tray underneath it. Set the cake the right way up.</p>

                    <h3 class="h3">Step 3.</h3>
                    <img src="img/Lemon-Poppyseed-Cake-14.jpg" class="imgs">
                    <p class="p">To make the <em>syrup</em>, put the ingredients in a small saucepan and heat until the sugar has dissolved. 
                    Pierce the cake all over with a skewer then, while the cake is still warm, pour the syrup over slowly. Leave to cool.</p>

                    <h3 class="h3">Step 4.</h3>
                    <img src="img/Lemon-Pound-Cake-17.jpg" class="imgs">
                    <p class="p">Gradually add the lemon juice to the icing sugar and mix until just smooth. If runny, put in the fridge for about 10 mins – you don’t want it to set, 
                    you just want it become a little firmer. Pour or spread the icing over the cake (the bits that drizzle down the side will be caught by the tray under the cooling rack). 
                    This icing won’t set hard, but do leave it to set a little before serving.</p>
